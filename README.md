# Windows-Debugger-and-Disassembler
Basic Windows 32-bit debugger with several different functions to aid in static analysis, malware analysis, and computer forensics. 
Some of the debugger functions include setting breakpoints, crash mode, and viewing different registers. 
This tool can also completely disassemble an executable, inject shellcode and DLL's into processes, monitor process creation, directories, and files.
The GitHub includes the debugger, a test executable (that crashes as well), and a test DLL for injection. Everything has been tested on and works on Windows 7-10. This was built to learn from.
# Update
The most recent update moved a few things around and added debugger hiding, hex viewer,address disassembler, and real time register editing! Pictures are now slightly different from the actual application.
# Overview of Functions:

![Alt text](images/img1.PNG?raw=true "Screenshot")
# Main Debugger
The main window `^shown above^` contains all the features. To get started, select `File-Attach` and enter a PID to attach to.
Launching executable is also possible`File-Open`, but most of the debugging features don't support it, so just stick with attaching.
When ready, just hit `Start` and watch the debugger work. The debugger is currently in `Default` mode. The first output is DLL's the executable is loading, and then debugging codes:

# Breakpoints
![Alt text](images/imgBreakPoints.PNG?raw=true "Screenshot")
For adding breakpoints, before the debugger is launched, edit the `BreakPoints.txt` file. this file must be in the same directory as the debugger if you want to use them.
The file contains something like this:

```
msvcrt.dll, printf
msvcrt.dll, strncpy
msvcrt.dll, sprintf
msvcrt.dll, vsprintf
```
To add breakpoints, add the DLL its found in, and then the function. To set what a breakpoint does, go to `Breakpoints-When a breakpoint is hit` and select an option.
The options available are to: `Just say Breakpoint Hit` which does what is says, `SEH Unwind` which shows the last lines of the SEH handler, `Stack unwind` which unwinds and displays the stack memory, `Disassem Around` which disassembles 10 instructions around the breakpoint, and last `All of the above plus extra` which shows everything just mentioned plus register states.

# Crash mode
![Alt text](images/imgCrashmode.PNG?raw=true "Screenshot")
Crash mode detects `exception_debug_event`, determines the cause of the crash, and prints tons of output.
# Created Files Mode
![Alt text](images/imgCreatedFiles.PNG?raw=true "Screenshot")
Hooks several Windows functions and prints files made, deleted, or modified.
# Process and File Monitoring
`Monitoring-File` starts monitoring Windows `tmp` directories and tries to dump the file contents. `Monitoring-Processes` monitors created processes and prints info on them. `Monitoring-List processes` list current processes and PID's (for attaching)

# Injection
DLL and Shellcode injection is also possible:

# Disassembly
Select `File-open` then `Debugger-disassemble` to disassemble the executable:

# Options
`Export` exports anything in the main text box to a file in the current directory. `Clear` clears the screen. `Colors off` turns colors off.
# Other files?
`BreakPoints.txt`: The file containing breakpoints.

`Buffer_overflow.exe`: A test exe, try attaching to it in crash mode!

`TestDLL.dll`: DLL to test with the dll injection feature.
# Problems
If you are experiencing crashes, try turning the color option off (`Options-Colors off`)

# Source code
Requires pydbg, pydasm, and win32con
